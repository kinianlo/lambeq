# BobcatParser throughput benchmark results

Corpus: 750 generated sentences (3-12 words), `/tmp/bobcat_bench.txt`,
see Task 1 of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-10-bobcat-throughput.md`.
Machine: Intel Core i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz, GPU: RTX 3080 Laptop present but CUDA unavailable (driver mismatch); GPU numbers to be collected later, RAM: 31 GB.

## Baseline (before optimizations)

Note: model default tagger batch_size is 4 (from pipeline_config.json).
